**About Pricing Update**

We are planning to make FlowDown free next year. As more developers join the project and core features mature, maintenance needs decrease, making it possible to provide the app at a lower cost (covering only essential expenses like domain, hosting, documentation site, and developer membership fees). Before transitioning to free, FlowDown will gradually reduce prices in phases. All conversations and chat features will remain free; subscription fees will only apply to new personalization options.

You can also join the public beta on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/StpMeybv) to try out new features.

To get you started, FlowDown includes complimentary access to a selection of models. For more power and control, you can easily connect to your own self-hosted services or any OpenAI-compatible provider. Learn more in our [documentation](https://apps.qaq.wiki/docs/flowdown/).

## Special Notes

FlowDown is designed for users who want full control over their AI models and are willing to configure them manually.

Every model behaves differently based on its capabilities, deployment method, and hardware resources. You are responsible for configuring and testing each model you use. FlowDown provides the tools and interfaces—you provide the configurations.

For bulk management, FlowDown supports importing and exporting model configurations (`.fdmodel` files). You can script the generation of configuration files and import them all at once. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UHKMRyJcgc) to discuss setups, but remember: community advice doesn't replace your own testing.
